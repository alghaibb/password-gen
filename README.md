# Random Password Generator

## Description

Welcome to <Random Password Generator>! This project aims to provide a simple yet powerful solution for generating secure and customizable random passwords. 

Motivation:
I developed this project to empower users with the ability to create passwords that match their specific requirements. Rather than relying on default password generators, this tool puts users in control.

Problem Solving:
By allowing users to choose password length (4-32 characters) and character sets (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols), the project addresses the need for passwords that are both secure and memorable.

Key Takeaways:
Throughout the development of this project, I learned about front-end web development, JavaScript logic, and user-friendly design principles.
